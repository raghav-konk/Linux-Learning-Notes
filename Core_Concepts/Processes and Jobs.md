- Its own memory and environment
- Resources like CPU and file descriptors
- consumes RAM

### Basic Commands

```bash
ps            # Shows current shell's active processes
ps aux        # Lists all running processes in detail
top           # Live, updating list of processes
htop          # Colorful, interactive version of top (must install, doesn't come pre installed)
